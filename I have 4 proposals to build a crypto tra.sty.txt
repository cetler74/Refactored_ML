I have 4 proposals to build a crypto trading bot with the same objective but slightly different approach. Can you please review all and proved the best unified approach using the best options of each proposal into a final best of bread implementation:

Proposal 1
Key Points
* The crypto trading bot will have simulation and live modes, both using real exchange data, with simulation recording orders in the database without executing them.
* It seems likely that the bot will be modular, with a bot orchestrator managing tasks, and use machine learning (ML) for dynamic trading strategies.
* Research suggests that LSTM and Random Forest models are effective for crypto trading, adapting to market conditions.
* The bot will include modules for exchange interaction, balance management, trading pair selection (excluding stable coins, with USDC pairs), technical analysis (TA) across 1m, 5m, 15m, 1h timeframes, and a trading strategy module.
* A frontend will display portfolio details, active/closed trades, and profit/loss, with configuration and database support for storing all trading data.
Bot Overview
This trading bot is designed for the spot market, offering both simulation and live modes to test strategies without risk and execute real trades. Both modes use real-time exchange data, ensuring consistency in decision-making processes. The bot’s modular structure, led by a bot orchestrator, integrates machine learning to enhance trading strategies dynamically based on market conditions.
Module Functions and Dependencies
Each module has specific roles, supported by appropriate software:
* Exchange Module: Fetches real-time data and places orders in live mode, using ccxt.
* Balance Manager: Tracks real and simulated balances, ensuring sufficient funds, using Python’s decimal for precision.
* Trading Pair Module: Selects USDC pairs dynamically, excluding stable coins and pairs in cooldown, using pandas for analysis.
* Technical Analysis Module: Calculates indicators for 1m, 5m, 15m, 1h timeframes, leveraging TA-Lib or pandas-ta.
* Machine Learning Model: Uses LSTM or Random Forest for predictions, supported by TensorFlow or PyTorch.
* Trading Strategy Module: Applies entry/exit rules based on TA and ML, adapting to market conditions.
* Config Module: Manages settings via configparser or YAML, ensuring flexibility.
* Database Handler: Interfaces with PostgreSQL or InfluxDB for data storage, using SQLAlchemy or psycopg2.
* Frontend Module: Displays portfolio and trades, built with Flask and React.
Trade Flows
* Entry Trade: The bot selects pairs, calculates TA indicators, uses ML for predictions, checks balance, and either places orders (live) or records them (simulation).
* Exit Trade: Monitors open positions, updates TA, applies exit rules via ML, and executes sells in live mode or records in simulation.
* ML Training: Periodically retrains on historical data, evaluating and deploying updated models.

Survey Note: Detailed Design of the Crypto Trading Bot
This comprehensive design outlines a modular cryptocurrency trading bot for the spot market, operating in both simulation and live modes, leveraging machine learning for enhanced trading strategies.

Flow of an Entry Trade, Including ML Training
ML Training Process:
* Periodically (e.g., daily), the Bot Orchestrator initiates training using historical market data from the Database Handler. Data includes OHLCV and TA indicators for selected pairs and timeframes.
* The ML Model preprocesses data (normalizing, feature engineering), trains using LSTM or Random Forest, validates performance (e.g., accuracy, MSE), and deploys the updated model for real-time use.
Entry Trade Flow:
1. Trading Pair Module: Analyzes current market data, selects top USDC pairs (e.g., BTC/USDC) based on volatility and volume, excluding stable coins and pairs in cooldown, and sends the list to the Bot Orchestrator.
2. Technical Analysis Module: Calculates indicators (e.g., 50-day EMA, RSI) for 1m, 5m, 15m, 1h timeframes for each pair, providing values to the ML Model and Trading Strategy Module.
3. Machine Learning Model: Uses TA indicators and market data to predict entry points (e.g., buy signal) for each timeframe, sending predictions to the Trading Strategy Module.
4. Trading Strategy Module: Applies dynamic rules (e.g., “Buy if RSI < 30 on 5m and ML predicts uptrend on 1h”) to decide on entry, selecting the best timeframe based on market conditions.
5. Bot Orchestrator: Receives the buy signal, checks with the Balance Manager for sufficient funds (real or simulated based on mode).
6. Balance Manager: Validates balance, reserves the amount, and confirms to the Bot Orchestrator.
7. Exchange Module: In live mode, places the buy order via the exchange API; in simulation mode, records the intended order in the database without execution.
8. Database Handler: Logs trade details (timestamp, pair, amount, price, TA indicators, ML predictions, mode) to the Database, updating balance records.
Flow of an Exit Trade
1. Technical Analysis Module: Continuously updates indicators for open positions across all timeframes.
2. Machine Learning Model: Provides updated predictions for exit points based on current data and trends.
3. Trading Strategy Module: Applies exit rules (e.g., “Sell if profit > 5% and ML predicts downturn on 15m, confirmed by 1h trend”), dynamically selecting timeframes.
4. Bot Orchestrator: Initiates the sell process upon receiving an exit signal.
5. Exchange Module: In live mode, places the sell order; in simulation mode, records the sell in the database.
6. Balance Manager: Updates available balance with sale proceeds (real or simulated), releasing reserved funds.
7. Database Handler: Records exit trade details (timestamp, price, profit/loss, TA indicators, ML predictions, mode), updating trade history.
Mode-Specific Considerations
* Simulation Mode: Fetches real-time data from the exchange, simulates trades by recording intended orders and balance changes in the database, flagged as simulations. Allows backtesting without financial risk.
* Live Mode: Executes actual orders on the exchange, tracking real balances and positions, with all other flows identical to simulation mode except for order execution.
Database Design
To manage the volume of data, the database includes:
* Market Data Table: Stores OHLCV for 1m, 5m, 15m, 1h timeframes, partitioned by pair and timestamp, optimized with TimescaleDB or InfluxDB.
* Trades Table: Logs entry/exit details, including timestamps, prices, quantities, fees, profit/loss, mode (live/simulation), TA indicators, and ML predictions.
* Balance Table: Tracks real and simulated balances, with mode flags for distinction.
* Configuration Table: Stores bot settings, API keys (encrypted), and strategy parameters.
Table Name	Key Fields	Purpose
Market_Data	pair, timestamp, timeframe, open, high, low, close, volume	Stores historical and real-time market data
Trades	trade_id, pair, entry_time, entry_price, exit_time, exit_price, mode, conditions	Logs trade details, including simulation/live
Balances	account_id, timestamp, available_balance, mode	Tracks real and simulated balances
Configurations	config_key, config_value, module	Stores bot settings and parameters
Frontend Features
The frontend provides:
* Dashboard: Displays total profit/loss, win rate, and current mode.
* Active Trades View: Lists open positions with entry price, current price, profit/loss, and timeframe signals.
* Closed Trades View: Shows historical trades with entry/exit details and performance metrics.
* Configuration Panel: Allows mode switching (with confirmation for live mode) and parameter adjustments.
* Real-Time Updates: Uses websockets for live data, ensuring users see current portfolio status.
Security measures include authentication, encrypted storage for API keys, and role-based access control to prevent unauthorized changes, especially in live mode.
Implementation Considerations
* Error Handling: The bot should handle API failures, network issues, and unexpected data with retry logic and logging, ensuring robustness.
* API Rate Limits: Manage exchange API calls efficiently, possibly aggregating 1m data and computing higher timeframes to minimize calls, depending on exchange limits (e.g., Binance API).
* Scalability: Modular design ensures scalability, with asynchronous operations (asyncio) handling concurrent tasks like data fetching and trade execution.
* Risk Management: Implement sanity checks before orders (e.g., price within expected ranges) and profit protection mechanisms (stop-loss, take-profit) to mitigate losses.
This design provides a comprehensive, adaptable solution for crypto trading, balancing simulation for strategy testing and live trading for execution, with robust ML integration and user-friendly monitoring.
